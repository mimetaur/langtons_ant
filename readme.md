## Langton's Ant

Langton's Ant is simple two dimensional cellular automata where simple rules ultimately lead to complex behavior.

Included here are two sketches for Norns based on Langton's Ant.

1. *Sines* generates a series of additive harmonic sine waves based on the Norns "Sines" engine by Zebra.

2. *PolyPerc* makes an infinite algorithmic melody based on the Norns "PolyPerc" engine by Tehn.

Each one bases aspects of its sound creation on the X and Y positions of the Ant and its number of neighbors.

### Notes
* If the results seem too repetative, increase the number of ants. As multiple ants cross each other's paths, the results rapidly become chaotic.
* Sound and system parameters are found in Params.
